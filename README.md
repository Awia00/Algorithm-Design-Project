# Algorithm Design Project
This is the repository of Anders Wind Steffensen and Mikael Lindemann for shared information and code for the course Algorithm Design Project.

We will try to implement an algorithm for the <a href="https://pacechallenge.wordpress.com/pace-2017/track-b-minimum-fill-in/">PACE Challenge 2017 Track B - Minimum Fill-In</a>.

The algorithm will be based on the article <a href="http://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/11085390X">Subexponential Parameterized Algorithm for Minimum Fill-in by Fomin and Villanger</a>.
